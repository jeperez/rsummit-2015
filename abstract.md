# Expanding R Exposure through Early Introduction in the Undergraduate Curriculum

In this talk we discuss approaches for effectively integrating R into an 
introductory statistics curriculum. R is attractive because, unlike software 
designed specifically for courses at this level, it is relevant beyond the 
introductory statistics classroom, and is more powerful and flexible. The main 
obstacle to the adoption and use of R in an introductory setting is the perceived 
challenge of teaching programming in addition to teaching statistical concepts. 
Furthermore, working at a command line tends to be more intimidating to students 
and teachers than GUI-based tools. Many of these challenges can be overcome with 
the right tools: a user-friendly IDE like RStudio, which is invaluable for 
resolving some of the initial hurdles novice students experience with the bare-
bones R interface, and labs and activities that use the right balance of standard 
and custom R functions. We will present examples from labs that have been 
developed with the goal of helping students synthesize concepts while learning R 
and do so in a completely reproducible framework using R Markdown. We will discuss 
benefits of this approach, not only with respect to creating opportunities for 
discussing the importance of reproducible research, but also for learning syntax, 
avoiding common novice pitfalls, and organizing and unifying output and write-ups. 
Additionally we will share approaches for introducing students to R outside of the 
classroom as well as student experiences and feedback.
